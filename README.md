# PyViz_homework

Within this homework submission are two JupyterLab notebooks, "rental_analysis.ipynb" and "dashboard.ipynb." 

---
#### rental_analysis.ipynb
Please start by running all cells in the "rental_analysis.ipynb" notebook from the top down to see the various types of data analysis and graphic outputs.

---
#### dashboard.ipynb
Then continue by running all cells in the "dashboard.ipynb" notebook from the top down to see the tabbed dashboard output. As you can see, each type of output requested does display correctly in the body of the notebook, but for some reason the first ("Welcome") and fourth ("Parallel Plots Analysis") tabs do not display their content in the dashboard. I would appreciate any feedback to get this feature working! In the second ("Yearly Market Analysis") tab you can see 3 charts laid out horizontally in a row. In the third ("Neighborhood Analysis") tab you can see 2 charts laid out vertically in a column. In the fourth ("Parallel Plots Analysis") you should see 2 charts laid out vertically in a column. In the first ("Welcome") tab you should see the neighborhood map.
